# Seoul_Music_Awards
Just wanted to see how Loona is going at the Main category.

Notebooks:

* web_scraping_and_df_creation.ipynb - scraps the data and creates the dataframe 

* dataframe_update.ipynb - for import purpose, uses pretty much the same code as seen in "web_scraping_and_df_creation.ipynb" to navigate the Seoul Music Awards website but returns the dataframe instead of saving it

* updating_df_and_graphs.ipynb - updates the dataframe and show some graphs

* update_df_periodically.ipynb - updates the dataframe hourly (so i don't need to run the code myself)
